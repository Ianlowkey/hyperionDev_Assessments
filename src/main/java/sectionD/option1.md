<h2> Option 1: Student Progress </h2>

<p> As a mentor, you are invested in every studentâ€™s progress, as well as
responsible for ensuring high task completion and graduation rates for our
bootcamps.
In the following hypothetical situation, you have 20 part-time students on
a 6-month bootcamp. Of this group, 5 students are 2 weeks behind on
their expected progress in the bootcamp, 10 are at risk of falling behind (if
they do not complete their next task in the next 2 days, they will be behind)
and 5 are ahead of expected progress. Please lay out an intervention plan
to get the 5 lagging students back on track whilst ensuring that the 10
at-risk students do not fall behind and the 5 students that are ahead are
not negatively impacted. </p>

<h2> Answer</h2>

I would suggest that 3 students(that are ahead of expected progress) help the 5 students that are two weeks 
behind on the progress. From the three students, they could either rotate the help that they give, or they
could each give a break-down of a particular section from the past 2 weeks.

The other 2 students (that are ahead of expected progress) would help the 10 students that are at risk
of falling behind. I would suggest that the two students give a break-down of the current task and share any
notes that helped them complete the task. The 2 students could also be given a list of the frequently asked questions
from the 10 students, from there a print-out or email with the answers could be sent out.
