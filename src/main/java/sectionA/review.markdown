<h3>General Comments </h3> 

- Commenting and explaining what each variable created is used for is a very good practice.
- Explaining the for loop in line 32, 33, and 34 is good practice, it allows anyone looking at your code to know what is happening

<h4>Correctness</h4>
The naming principles of the variables and methods are correct, they are detailed enough to set them apart.
The order that the methods are in follows a logical order.

<h4>Efficiency</h4>
The code written is efficient and gives the desired outcome, once the errors are corrected.

<h4>Style</h4>
The style of the code is neat and clear. Different methods are easy to find, as well as the different variable.
The code also does not feel overwhelming to look at.

<h3> Errors </h3>
Line 22: Return the correct variable, you are currently returning a variable that is non-existent,
and it is kicking out an error.

Line 26: The variable declared as "maxNumber" is already declared in line 24. A way to fix this error
could be to change the variable (maxNumber) name, don't forget to change the corresponding names as well.
